 Elevvo Pathways - Machine Learning Internship Tasks 🚀

This repository contains three machine learning projects completed as part of my internship with Elevvo Pathways. Each task is designed to explore core ML concepts like regression, clustering, and multi-class classification using real-world datasets.

 📌 Tasks Overview

 ✅ Task 1: Student Score Prediction
- Objective: Predict students' exam scores based on their study hours.
- Dataset: [Student Performance Factors – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)
- Techniques Used: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`
- Bonus: Polynomial regression comparison

 ✅ Task 2: Customer Segmentation
- Objective: Cluster mall customers based on their annual income and spending score.
- Dataset: [Mall Customers – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers)
- Techniques Used: K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN
- Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`
- Bonus: Try DBSCAN & analyze spending behavior per cluster
